# SET

## Summary
The goal of this challenge is to write a program to help play the game of SET
(http://www.setgame.com/). In particular, it should find the largest number of disjoint SETs in a
collection of SET cards.

## Prerequisite
* Java SE-1.8
* JDK 8
* UNIX System to run "cat" command

## Start the Program
1) Open a terminal and use "cd" command to the src directory of the project
2) Type 'javac Main.java'. This should compile the java code.
3) Type 'cat "input.txt" | java Main'. The "input.txt" can be replaced with other local file in the src folder.
